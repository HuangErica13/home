			<h3>The arts are a big part of my life. From dancing ballet to just listening to music at home, I've always enjoyed them.</h3>

					<p>
						I've been dancing ballet since kindergarten, and it's something I still love to this day. I also enjoy<br>
						exploring other types of dance, including just freestyle. The studio I take classes at is The School of<br>
						Toronto City Ballet. Usually, at the end of every school year, the entire studio performs at the FLATO<br>
						Markham Theatre, but that won't be happening because of the pandemic. Our classes have also become<br>
						online Zoom meetings for the same reason. The repertoire we learn in class is for the Royal Academy<br>
						of Dance (RAD) exams. I am currently learning the Advanced 1 (A1) dances.

						These pictures show me in a few of the costumes I've danced in through the years. The picture furthest<br>
						to the right is the ending of a long dance our class did with dancers in higher grades.

					<p>
						I love listening to many kinds of music, but I mostly listen to pop. I like to listen while studying,<br>
						biking, doing chores, and basically any chance I get. Most of the time, I'll sing along as well<br>
						(my voice isn't the best though).<br><br>
						I like to play other instruments, too. At school, I played the French Horn for band, and joined the<br>
						choir. Outside of school, I used to take piano lessons. I passed the Level 8 exams a few years ago,<br>
						but I haven't done anything further yet. Every now and then, I just play song covers for fun. Anyway,<br>
						I've put one of my performances here, if you want to see it.<br>

						When I was younger, I took painting and sketching lessons for a few years.<br>
						I still can't draw people, though.<br>
						Here's some art I've made...

					<p>
						I learned how to create augmented reality (AR) art in a virtual workshop just last summer.<br>
						It was a lot of fun, and I'm pretty happy with the final piece of art I ended up creating. We used<br>
						the <a href = "https://artivive.com/" target = "_blank">Artivive</a> platform, and you need the Artivive app to be able to view the AR. I put my<br>
						target image below; if you're interested in viewing the AR, you'll have to download the app. Then,<br>
						you just open the app, point the camera to the target image, and you'll see the AR on your device.<br>
